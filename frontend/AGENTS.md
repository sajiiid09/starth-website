# Frontend Agent Notes

## User Dashboard Redesign

### Current Status
- Phase 1 is complete.
- Organizer/User dashboard default landing now uses `OrganizerAIWorkspace`.
- Required documentation has been added in `docs/USERDASHBOARD_DEVELOPMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md`.

### Next Phase To Do
- Implement Phase 2: chat-first AI workspace content and the right-side planning/context panel inside the dashboard shell.

### Key Decisions
- Public website AI planner remains unchanged.
- Dashboard AI entry points no longer reuse the public AI planner page.
- Vendor and admin dashboards remain unchanged in this phase.
